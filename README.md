# orm-uci
Within the framework I developed during my internship, I also created an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)-like project 
that harnesses the power of the UCI (Unified Configuration Interface) library.
This project significantly improves the way data is parsed and managed within the framework, making it more accessible and efficient.
